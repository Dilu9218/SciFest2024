Exploring the Harmonic Spectra Produced by Musical Instruments through FFT 

Timbre is the characteristic that distinguishes two sounds with the same pitch and loudness. 
One of the key factors contributing to timbre is the relative strength of various spectral components. 
Through this activity, we observe how these components vary across instruments, providing insight into their unique sound signatures.
 
This idea has inspired our research on identification  of low-power  analog backscatter tags. 


This activity visualizes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of ten different musical instruments.  
For this demonstration: 
All instruments except the Drumkit play the note C3.
Recording length is 4  beats at a 120 BPM tempo. 

Select an instrument from the dropdown menu to view its corresponding FFT and examine its harmonic structure.
